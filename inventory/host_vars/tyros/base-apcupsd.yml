  #
  # ======== Configuration parameters used during power failures ==========
  #

  # The ONBATTERYDELAY is the time in seconds from when a power failure
  #   is detected until we react to it with an onbattery event.
  #
  #   This means that, apccontrol will be called with the powerout argument
  #   immediately when a power failure is detected.  However, the
  #   onbattery argument is passed to apccontrol only after the
  #   ONBATTERYDELAY time.  If you don't want to be annoyed by short
  #   powerfailures, make sure that apccontrol powerout does nothing
  #   i.e. comment out the wall.
  ONBATTERYDELAY 10

  #
  # Note: BATTERYLEVEL, MINUTES, and TIMEOUT work in conjunction, so
  # the first that occurs will cause the initation of a shutdown.
  #

  # If during a power failure, the remaining battery percentage
  # (as reported by the UPS) is below or equal to BATTERYLEVEL,
  # apcupsd will initiate a system shutdown.
  BATTERYLEVEL 5

  # If during a power failure, the remaining runtime in minutes
  # (as calculated internally by the UPS) is below or equal to MINUTES,
  # apcupsd, will initiate a system shutdown.
  MINUTES 5

  # If during a power failure, the UPS has run on batteries for TIMEOUT
  # many seconds or longer, apcupsd will initiate a system shutdown.
  # A value of 0 disables this timer.
  #
  #  Note, if you have a Smart UPS, you will most likely want to disable
  #    this timer by setting it to zero. That way, you UPS will continue
  #    on batteries until either the % charge remaing drops to or below BATTERYLEVEL,
  #    or the remaining battery runtime drops to or below MINUTES.  Of course,
  #    if you are testing, setting this to 60 causes a quick system shutdown
  #    if you pull the power plug.
  #  If you have an older dumb UPS, you will want to set this to less than
  #    the time you know you can run on batteries.
  TIMEOUT 0

  #  Time in seconds between annoying users to signoff prior to
  #  system shutdown. 0 disables.
  ANNOY 180

  # Initial delay after power failure before warning users to get
  # off the system.
  ANNOYDELAY 90

  # The condition which determines when users are prevented from
  # logging in during a power failure.
  # NOLOGON <string> [ disable | timeout | percent | minutes | always ]
  NOLOGON disable

  # If KILLDELAY is non-zero, apcupsd will continue running after a
  # shutdown has been requested, and after the specified time in
  # seconds attempt to kill the power. This is for use on systems
  # where apcupsd cannot regain control after a shutdown.
  # KILLDELAY <seconds>  0 disables
  KILLDELAY 0

  #
  # ==== Configuration statements for Network Information Server ====
  #

  # NETSERVER [ on | off ] on enables, off disables the network
  #  information server. If netstatus is on, a network information
  #  server process will be started for serving the STATUS and
  #  EVENT data over the network (used by CGI programs).
  NETSERVER on

  # NISIP <dotted notation ip address>
  #  IP address on which NIS server will listen for incoming connections.
  #  This is useful if your server is multi-homed (has more than one
  #  network interface and IP address). Default value is 0.0.0.0 which
  #  means any incoming request will be serviced. Alternatively, you can
  #  configure this setting to any specific IP address of your server and
  #  NIS will listen for connections only on that interface. Use the
  #  loopback address (127.0.0.1) to accept connections only from the
  #  local machine.
  NISIP {{ private_ip }}

  # NISPORT <port> default is 3551 as registered with the IANA
  #  port to use for sending STATUS and EVENTS data over the network.
  #  It is not used unless NETSERVER is on. If you change this port,
  #  you will need to change the corresponding value in the cgi directory
  #  and rebuild the cgi programs.
  NISPORT 3551

  # If you want the last few EVENTS to be available over the network
  # by the network information server, you must define an EVENTSFILE.
  EVENTSFILE /var/log/apcupsd.events

  # EVENTSFILEMAX <kilobytes>
  #  By default, the size of the EVENTSFILE will be not be allowed to exceed
  #  10 kilobytes.  When the file grows beyond this limit, older EVENTS will
  #  be removed from the beginning of the file (first in first out).  The
  #  parameter EVENTSFILEMAX can be set to a different kilobyte value, or set
  #  to zero to allow the EVENTSFILE to grow without limit.
  EVENTSFILEMAX 25

  #
  # ========== Configuration statements used if sharing =============
  #            a UPS with more than one machine

  #
  # Remaining items are for ShareUPS (APC expansion card) ONLY
  #

  # UPSCLASS [ standalone | shareslave | sharemaster ]
  #   Normally standalone unless you share a UPS using an APC ShareUPS
  #   card.
  UPSCLASS standalone

  # UPSMODE [ disable | share ]
  #   Normally disable unless you share a UPS using an APC ShareUPS card.
  UPSMODE disable

  #
  # ===== Configuration statements to control apcupsd system logging ========
  #

  # Time interval in seconds between writing the STATUS file; 0 disables
  STATTIME 0

  # Location of STATUS file (written to only if STATTIME is non-zero)
  STATFILE /var/log/apcupsd.status

  # LOGSTATS [ on | off ] on enables, off disables
  # Note! This generates a lot of output, so if
  #       you turn this on, be sure that the
  #       file defined in syslog.conf for LOG_NOTICE is a named pipe.
  #  You probably do not want this on.
  LOGSTATS off

  # Time interval in seconds between writing the DATA records to
  #   the log file. 0 disables.
  DATATIME 0

  # FACILITY defines the logging facility (class) for logging to syslog.
  #          If not specified, it defaults to "daemon". This is useful
  #          if you want to separate the data logged by apcupsd from other
  #          programs.
  #FACILITY DAEMON
